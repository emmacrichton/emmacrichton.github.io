<p>A fourth year Business (Marketing)/Journalism undergraduate student at QUT, with an interest in marketing, advertising, media and communications. I have sought out many opportunities to explore and develop the skillset I have gained from my university studies thus far. Currently, I am working with ChekRite, an innovative start-up company to expand their inbound marketing strategy.</p>

<p>A self-proclaimed 'third-culture kid', I have a strong passion for connecting with people from different cultures, which can be traced back to my childhood years where I grew up living in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Egypt.</p>

<p>I believe my interpersonal skills gained from my unusual upbringing and my willingness to develop my experience within the marketing and communications sector make me a valuable asset to many companies.</p>

<p id="skills">My skills are:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Inbound marketing</li>
	<li>Social Media</li>	
	<li>Quality content creation</li></ul>
